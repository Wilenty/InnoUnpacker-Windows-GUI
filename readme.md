#### Inspect and unpack InnoSetup archives

[Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) is a popular program
for making software installations. To verify and get files out of the self-extracting 
executable, these open source console application are available:

- Original version [Innounp](http://sourceforge.net/projects/innounp) (can be used up to InnoSetup 6.1)
- Updated Unicode version [Innounp-1](innounp-1) (can be used up to InnoSetup 6.3)

**InnoUnpacker** is a graphical user interface (GUI) for these console applications
that makes the usage more comfortable.
The executable setup to be processed can be loaded via a file selection dialog, just 
by drag & drop, using the command line or by an entry in the Windows context menu for exe files. 
Immediately after opening, the basic file info and the list 
of included files are displayed. To extract files, just click the 
appropriate button and select the destination directory. Optionally, a filter 
can be specified to extract only the matching files.
