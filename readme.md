### Inno Setup Unpacker - Windows GUI

#### Inspect and unpack InnoSetup archives

[Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) is a popular program
for making software installations. To verify and get files out of the self-extracting 
executable, you can use the open source console application
[Innounp](http://sourceforge.net/projects/innounp).

**InnoUnpacker** is a graphical user interface (GUI) for this console application
that makes the usage more comfortable.
The executable setup to be processed can be loaded via a file selection dialog, just 
by drag & drop, using the command line or by an entry in the Windows context menu for exe files. 
Immediately after opening, the basic file info and the list 
of included files are displayed. To extract files, just click the 
appropriate button and select the destination directory. Optionally, a filter 
can be specified to extract only the matching files.
