### Inno Setup Unpacker - Windows GUI

##### Inspect and unpack InnoSetup archives

[Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) is a popular program
for making software installations. To verify and get files out of the self-extracting 
executable, you can use the open source console application
[Innounp](http://sourceforge.net/projects/innounp).

**InnoUnpack** is a graphical user interface (GUI) for this console application
that makes the usage more comfortable.
The executable setup to be processed can be loaded via a file selection dialog or 
just by drag & drop. The basic file info and the list of included files are displayed 
immediately. To extract files, just click the appropriate button and select
the destination directory. Optionally, a filter can be specified
to extract only the matching files.
